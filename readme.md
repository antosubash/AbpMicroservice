# ABP Microservice Template
[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Anto.Abp.Microservice.Template)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anto.Abp.Microservice.Template)
## Why?

This is a template for creating a microservice with ABP using the dotnet. This template is created to make it easier to create a new microservice project with ABP. It is based on the blog post [.NET Microservice with ABP](https://blog.antosubash.com/posts/abp-microservice-series) series I have made earlier. It is created using the [dotnet new template engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates) and it is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anto.Abp.Microservice.Template/).

## Usage

### Install the template

```bash
dotnet new install Anto.Abp.Microservice.Template
```

### Create a new project

```bash
dotnet new abp-ms -n MyProjectName
```
